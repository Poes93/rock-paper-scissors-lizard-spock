## User Experience (UX)

#### Why This Website Exists

I made this website to provide users with an engaging and accessible experience while playing the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. It also offers visual customization through theme selection and ensures users have a clear understanding of the game rules.

#### User Stories 

User Stories

Starting the Game: User sees a start screen with title and button. Clicking "Start Game" opens game content.

Choosing a Move: User sees Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock images for selection. User needs to pick an one. Clicking an image shows win, loss, or draw outcome.

Viewing Score: Current score displayed. Option to reset score available.

Theme Selection: Option for dark mode provided.

Viewing Game Rules: Button to view game rules present. Option to return to game from rules.

Footer & Links: Footer shows copyright and creator's GitHub link.

Accessibility: Alt text for all images ensured. Clear labels for all interactive items.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colors used in the website are:

* #ffffff: Used as the main color

### Bugs

These are the current bugs on the website. I can't seem to find out how to currently solve them. I think these issues is due to the Nav/header bar with the scaling of the elements.


* The footer is not the same size as the header
