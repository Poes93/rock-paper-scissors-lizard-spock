## Testing

## Testing 

* Website was tested on the following browsers and with a Macbook Pro 14" 2021: Chrome, Safari and Brave.
* For mobile it's been tested on a iPhone 13 Pro.
* The website is responsive when using Google Devtools responsive screen adjuster.
* The navigation and the sections Home, About, trails, gear, tips and contact works fine. Except that the user needs to scroll up a bit to get to the start of the section.
* The form works: it requires entries in every field, only accepts an email in the email field, and the submit button works and the user will get a new window to confirm its been sent.
* The text adapts in width to accommodate smaller o larger screens, always taking up the width available.
* There are no broken links on the page

### Bugs

These are the current bugs on the website. I can't seem to find out how to currently solve them. I think these issues is due to the Nav/header bar with the scaling of the elements.

* When opening the page on mobile the nav menu is already open and to close it one need to press the bars to close the menu. Same when pressing the links, the menu wont disapear automatically. 

* Scaling for Hero image and position may differ on webrowser but also needs more adjustment on phone.

* Header text wont adjust evenly when on different screen sizes.

* When pressing the links as the header is always on top and the links goes to the section header, it will be hidden under the header.

* Some issues with scaling the nav bar that it sometimes disapears. Reload the page will solve that issue for now.
